# Oct 7 version changes #

  * Mac support
  * Fixed bugsplat with split command under SU8
  * You can now delete embedded sounds.
  * Added controllerValue= field to runtime created joints.
  * Added script commands setCursorPosition,getCursorPosition and showCursor. This allows First Person Shooter style mouse control of the camera.
  * Keep control panel in front of display even when mouse is clicked. This should fix the problem of the control panel losing focus and causing the simulation to reset when a key is pressed.
