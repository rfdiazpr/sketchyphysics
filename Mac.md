What??? No Mac version?? Why?

Because, I don't have a Mac and don't know how to program one. If you are a very experienced Mac coder (know now to make a Mac dynamically linked library?) and are willing to spend a few weeks working on the port and the time necessary to support it, post in the discussion area.
